My name is Sam Johnston

I am passionate about developing quality models and simulations. I love to tinker with parameters, and watch as unexpected behaviours emerge.
I believe there is tremendous potential for computational methods to break new ground in ecological and environmental sciences.
My dream is that someday, humanity will have available a large number of high accuracy models of te physical world, allowing us to make decisions that minimize long-term consequences.
I hope to take part in the computational revolution of the natural sciences.
